# Portfolio project

This site has been made using HTML, SCSS and some basic JavaScript as an initial project for my _nology course.

Over the duration of the course it will be iterated over and added to, to showcase new or improved skills.


### To-do:

With the first iteration in place, I want to spend some time looking at some professionally built portfolios. Things I have noticed and would like to iplement on the next iteration:

Change the email contact from a mailto: to a form. This seems like a more sensible option, looks cleaner, and can be done in-browser instead of a user having to 
open their mail client.

Find a better colour palette.

Set the 'return to top' as a constant button, locked to the bottom of the screen.

Change favicon to something more appropriate

Link Github projects, update image and text as they are completed.
